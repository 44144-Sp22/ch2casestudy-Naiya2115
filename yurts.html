    <h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>

    <p>What is a yurt?</p>
    <blockquote>
      Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt is
      fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.
    </blockquote>

    <p>How are the yurts furnished?</p>
    <blockquote>
      Each yurt is furnished with a queen-sized bed with down quilt and gas fire stove.
      Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold
      running water. Shower and restroom facilities are loacted in the lodge.
    </blockquote>

    <p>What should I bring?</p>
    <blockquote>
      Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing
      weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a
      sense of adventure!
